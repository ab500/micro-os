About Licensing
===============

Most of TinyOS's code has been edited and revised by so many different people
with so many different licenses. Those 50+ line licenses are annoying to read
and meaningless at this point.

If you want to take the reasonable route I've copy-pasted all the licenses
that I found here so you can read them. You should include them and as long
as you open-source your work it's probably fine. 

If you want to take the by-the-books route you shouldn't use any of this
code under any circumstance without contacting all the authors, many
of whom have moved onto other projects and will be difficult to contact,
and obtaining their individual permission in writing, making sure to
pay attention to the commit logs from TinyOS.

It's all BSD licensed. Just imagine the following block of text at the
top of every file:

/* Copyright (c) [some year between 1970 and this year] [some random university]

The license will be arbitrary replaced with some other random, vague license
often missing key pieces, at random.
